This project requires us to:
	1. display the customers in a list from customers.txt
		1.1 use sparkline.js to display sales data for each customer
		1.2 customer name is a link with customer id as query string
	2. Display the customer info based on customerId from url
		2.1 hide customer details when empty
	3. Display customer order details based on customerId from url
		3.1 hide Order details when empty
		3.2 If current customer has no orders, display "No orders for ____"

It looks like there will be 2 states for this project, customer = Null and customer = #
	$_GET["customer"] will be critical

	2nd field in order.txt is customer id
