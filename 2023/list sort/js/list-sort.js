 * Little idea for a stand alone library:
 *   When user clicks on a class="sortable" element the list reforms, sorted alphabetically.
 *    Probably changes class to class = "sort-down"
 *    Change all other classes of sort-down or sort-up to sortable
 *    If the user clicks again the list sorts reverse alphabetically.
 *    Probably change class to class = "sort-up"
 *    3rd click on same element returns list to generic sorting based on data.
