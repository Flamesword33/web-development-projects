 * Little idea for a stand alone library:
 *   Javascript will handle sorting the list. 
 *   Css will add icons and shading to sorted element based on class
 *   Class = sortable
 *     Add button like animations to the element
 *   Class = sort-down
 *     use caret-down-fill
 *     shade/change color of element
 *   Class = sort-up
 *     use caret-up-fill
 *     shade/change color of element (keep same as sort-down)
