			Before we get started it is important to discuss a basic character concept with your game master. 
			This system is dense with customization and a clear end goal can help you skim for abilities that work for you. <br><br>
            </p>
			<p align="center">
			The first step is to choose which stats you're good at. 
			Feel free to click each of the stats below to learn more about them. 
			<br>
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Pick a favorite and add 2 to it.</li>
				<li>Pick another stat to add 1 to.</li>
				<li>Choose 3 stats you feel your character will struggle with and subtract 1 from each.</li>
			</ol>
			
	<!--     - | stat | value | +
			 - | stealth | 2 | +
