    An app to learn to count back canadian change.
    
    Screen outputs 2 numbers, an amount payed and an amount owed
    User interacts with buttons, each a different coin value, a reset button and a submit button
    User is alerted by how long it took them and how much they were off by
    Canadians lack a 1 cent so numbers will be rounded when calculating how much is owed back
    
    This file should:
      Have a location for 2 dollar amounts
      Have buttons for
        nickle
        dime
        quarter
        dollar
        tunie
        $5
        $10
        $20
        $50
        $100
        reset
        submit-->
