    An app to learn to count back canadian change.
    
    Screen outputs 2 numbers, an amount payed and an amount owed
    User interacts with buttons, each a different coin value, a reset button and a submit button
    User is alerted by how long it took them and how much they were off by
    Canadians lack a 1 cent so numbers will be rounded when calculating how much is owed back
    
    This file will:
      center the page
      shrink coins to same size
      grow bills to correct size
      put padding and borders around every form of change
        should look like a cash register grid
      round borders of reset and submit buttons
