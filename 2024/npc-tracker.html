    A simple window to keep track of a NPC combatant in D&D 5e
    Will use in line javascript, should be a stand alone html
    I'm not going to bother to make this look nice with css

    Program will
      Give user a text box for name 
        rename page title to said name
      Give user a int box for max hp
        give user a secondary box and + - buttons to change hp
        Will not go over max hp
        ?auto fill hp based on inputing max?
        ?secondary box for temp hp?
        ?Close window upon going to 0 hp?
      Give int box for AC
      Give int box for modifier to hit with weapon
        ? + button to add more attacks?
      Give int box for damage modifier
        ?damage type text box?
      Give drop down for damage dice
      Roll attack button
      Output roll to hit and damage
        ?Output damage type?
