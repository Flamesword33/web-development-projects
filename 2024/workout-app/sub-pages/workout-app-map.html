    This app is a re-creation of an app I previously made over 2 weeks for a client.
    In 2020 myself and Oscar were working for the Camrose Fitness Center.
    We designed an app to welcome the user, introduce a user to the machines present
      based on images. 
    Each machine page included a picture of the machine, a video on how to use it and a further discription.
    Finally we included a link with google map data to show users how to get to the gym.
    
    Said original app is lost to time. All that remains are the assets I created for the endevor.
    
    This file will:
      Include buttons for going back, google maps and building map
      toggle to a google map of the building
      toggle to a map of the building
